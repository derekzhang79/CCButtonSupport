# Button support for Cocos2D-iPhone

This originates with [ObjectAL](https://github.com/kstenerud/ObjectAL-for-iPhone)'s
demo support code by *Karl Stenerud*. ObjectAL is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

I have simply extracted the Cocos2D-iPhone button related code, added a few
convenience methods to ImageButton and ImageAndLabelButton, and have packaged it
up so it can be used separately from ObjectAL.
